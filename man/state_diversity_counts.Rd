\title{Calculate Australian plant state-level diversity for native, introduced, and more complicated species origins}
\usage{
state_diversity_counts(
  state,
  resources = load_taxonomic_resources(version = default_version())
)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{A character string indicating the Australian state or territory to calculate the diversity for. Possible values are "NSW", "NT", "Qld", "WA", "ChI", "SA", "Vic", "Tas", "ACT", "NI", "LHI", "MI", "HI", "MDI", "CoI", "CSI", and "AR".}

\item{resources}{the taxonomic resources required to make the summary statistics.  loading this can be slow, so call load_taxonomic_resources separately to greatly speed this function up and pass the resources in.}
}
\value{
A tibble of diversity counts for the specified state or territory, including native, introduced, and more complicated species origins.
The tibble has three columns: "origin" indicating the origin of the species, "state" indicating the Australian state or territory, and "num_species" indicating the number of species for that origin and state.
}
\description{
This function calculates state-level diversity for native, introduced, and more complicated species origins based on the geographic data available in the current Australian Plant Census.
