\arguments{
\item{original_name}{A list of names to query for taxonomic alignments.}

\item{output}{(optional) The name of the file to save the results to.}

\item{full}{Parameter to determine how many columns are output}

\item{resources}{the taxonomic resources used to align the taxa names. Loading this can be slow,
so call \code{\link{load_taxonomic_resources}} separately to greatly speed this function up and pass the resources in.}

\item{fuzzy_abs_dist}{The number of characters allowed to be different for a fuzzy match.}

\item{fuzzy_rel_dist}{The proportion of characters allowed to be different for a fuzzy match.}

\item{fuzzy_matches}{Fuzzy matches are turned on as a default. The relative and absolute distances allowed for fuzzy matches to species and infraspecific taxon names are defined by the parameters \code{fuzzy_abs_dist} and \code{fuzzy_rel_dist}}

\item{imprecise_fuzzy_matches}{Imprecise fuzzy matches are turned off as a default.}

\item{APNI_matches}{Name matches to the APNI (Australian Plant Names Index) are turned off as a default.}

\item{identifier}{A dataset, location or other identifier, which defaults to NA.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns that include original_name, aligned_name, taxonomic_dataset, taxon_rank, aligned_reason, alignment_code.
\itemize{
\item original_name: the original plant name input.
\item aligned_name: the original plant name after the function standardise_names has standardised the syntax of infraspecific taxon designations.
\item taxonomic_dataset: the source of the aligned names (APC or APNI).
\item taxon_rank: the taxonomic rank of the aligned name.
\item aligned_reason: the explanation of a specific taxon name alignment (from an original name to an aligned name).
\item alignment_code: a code that accompanies the aligned_reason, indicating the relative sequence of the match during the alignment process.
\item cleaned_name: original name with punctuation and infraspecific taxon designation terms standardised by the function standardise_names; streamlines exact matches.
\item stripped_name: cleaned name with punctuation and infraspecific taxon designation terms removed by the function strip_names; improves fuzzy matches.
\item stripped_name2: cleaned name with punctuation, infraspecific taxon designation terms, and other filler words removed by the function strip_names_2; required for matches to \verb{first two word} and \verb{first three words}.
\item trinomial: the first three words in \code{stripped_name2}, required for matches that ignore all other text in the original_name; improves phrase name matches.
\item binomial: the first two words in \code{stripped_name2}, required for matches that ignore all other text in the original_name; improves phrase name matches.
\item genus: the first two words in \code{cleaned_name}; required for genus-rank matches and reprocessing of genus-rank names.
\item fuzzy_match_genus: fuzzy match of genus column to best match among APC-accepted names; required for fuzzy matches of genus-rank names.
\item fuzzy_match_genus_synonym: fuzzy match of genus column to best match among APC-known names, only considering different matches to those documented under APC-accepted genera; required for fuzzy matches of genus-rank names.
\item fuzzy_match_genus_APNI: fuzzy match of genus column to best match among APNI names, only considering different matches to those documented under APC-accepted and APC-known genera; required for fuzzy matches of genus-rank names.
\item fuzzy_match_cleaned_APC: fuzzy match of stripped_name to APC-accepted names; created for yet-to-be-aligned names at the match step 07a in the function \code{match_taxa}.
\item fuzzy_match_cleaned_APC_synonym: fuzzy match of stripped_name to APC-known names; created for yet-to-be-aligned names at the match step 07b in the function \code{match_taxa}.
\item fuzzy_match_cleaned_APC_imprecise: imprecise fuzzy match of stripped_name to APC-accepted names; created for yet-to-be-aligned names at the match step 10a in the function \code{match_taxa}.
\item fuzzy_match_cleaned_APC_synonym_imprecise: imprecise fuzzy match of stripped_name to APC-accepted names; created for yet-to-be-aligned names at the match step 10b in the function \code{match_taxa}.
\item fuzzy_match_binomial: fuzzy match of binomial column to best match among APC-accepted names; created for yet-to-be-aligned names at match step 15a in the function \code{match_taxa}.
\item fuzzy_match_binomial_APC_synonym: fuzzy match of binomial column to best match among APC-known names; created for yet-to-be-aligned names at match step 15a in the function \code{match_taxa}.
\item fuzzy_match_trinomial: fuzzy match of trinomial column to best match among APC-accepted names; created for yet-to-be-aligned names at match step 16a in the function \code{match_taxa}.
\item fuzzy_match_trinomial_synonym: fuzzy match of trinomial column to best match among APC-known names; created for yet-to-be-aligned names at match step 16b in the function \code{match_taxa}.
\item fuzzy_match_cleaned_APNI: fuzzy match of stripped_name to APNI names; created for yet-to-be-aligned names at the match step 16a in the function \code{match_taxa}.
\item fuzzy_match_cleaned_APNI_imprecise: imprecise fuzzy match of stripped_name to APNI names; created for yet-to-be-aligned names at the match step 17a in the function \code{match_taxa}.

\description{
This function finds taxonomic alignments in APC or scientific name alignments in APNI.
It uses the internal function \code{match_taxa} to attempt to match input strings to taxon names in the APC/APNI.
It sequentially searches for matches against more than 20 different string patterns,
prioritising exact matches (to accepted names as well as synonyms, orthographic variants) over fuzzy matches.
It prioritises matches to taxa in the APC over names in the APNI.
It identifies string patterns in input names that suggest a name can only be aligned to a genus
(hybrids that are not in the APC/ANI; graded species; taxa not identified to species),
and indicates these names only have a genus-rank match.
