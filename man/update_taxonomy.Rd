\usage{
update_taxonomy(
  aligned_data,
  taxonomic_splits = "most_likely_species",
  output = NULL,
  resources = load_taxonomic_resources()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{aligned_data}{A tibble of plant names to update. This table must include 5 columns, original_name, aligned_name, taxon_rank, taxonomic_dataset, and aligned_reason.
These columns are created by the function \code{align_taxa}.
The columns \code{original_name} and \code{aligned_name} must be in the format of the scientific name, with genus and species,
and may contain additional qualifiers such as subspecies or varieties. The names are case insensitive.}

\item{taxonomic_splits}{Variable that determines what protocol to use to update taxon names that are ambiguous due to taxonomic splits.
The three options are:
most_likely_species, which returns the species name in use before the split; alternative names are returned in a separate column
return_all, which returns all possible names
collapse_to_higher_taxon, which declares that an ambiguous name cannot be aligned to an accepted species/infraspecific name and the name is demoted to genus rank}

\item{output}{(optional) Name of the file where results are saved. The default is NULL and no file is created.
If specified, the output will be saved in a CSV file with the given name.}

\item{resources}{the taxonomic resources required to make the summary statistics.  Loading this can be slow, so call load_taxonomic_resources separately to greatly speed this function up and pass the resources in.}
}
\value{
A tibble with updated taxonomy for the specified plant names. The tibble contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item original_name: the original plant name.
\item aligned_name: the input plant name that has been aligned to a taxon name in the APC or APNI by the align_taxa function.
\item accepted_name: the APC-accepted plant name, when available.
\item suggested_name: the suggested plant name to use. Identical to the accepted_name, when an accepted_name exists; otherwise the the suggested_name is the aligned_name.
\item genus: the genus of the accepted (or suggested) name; only APC-accepted genus names are filled in.
\item family: the family of the accepted (or suggested) name; only APC-accepted family names are filled in.
\item taxon_rank: the taxonomic rank of the suggested (and accepted) name.
\item taxonomic_dataset: the source of the suggested (and accepted) names (APC or APNI).
\item taxonomic_status: the taxonomic status of the suggested (and accepted) name.
\item taxonomic_status_aligned: the taxonomic status of the aligned name, before any taxonomic updates have been applied.
\item aligned_reason: the explanation of a specific taxon name alignment (from an original name to an aligned name).
\item update_reason: the explanation of a specific taxon name update (from an aligned name to an accepted or suggested name).
\item subclass: the subclass of the accepted name.
\item taxon_distribution: the distribution of the accepted name; only filled in if an APC accepted_name is available.
\item scientific_name_authorship: the authorship information for the accepted (or known) name; available for both APC and APNI names.
\item taxon_ID: the unique taxon concept identifier for the accepted_name; only filled in if an APC accepted_name is available.
\item taxon_ID_genus: an identifier for the genus; only filled in if an APC-accepted genus name is available.
\item scientific_name_ID: an identifier for the nomenclatural (not taxonomic) details of a scientific name; available for both APC and APNI names.
\item row_number: the row number of a specific original_name in the input.
\item number_of_collapsed_taxa: when taxonomic_splits == "collapse_to_higher_taxon", the number of possible taxon names that have been collapsed.
}

\description{
This function uses the APC to update the taxonomy of names aligned to a taxon concept listed in the APC to the currently accepted name for the taxon concept.
The aligned_data data frame that is input must contain 5 columns,
\code{original_name}, \code{aligned_name}, \code{taxon_rank}, \code{taxonomic_dataset}, and \code{aligned_reason}.
The aligned name is a plant name that has been aligned to a taxon name in the APC or APNI by the align_taxa function.
