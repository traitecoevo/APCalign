\title{Standardises taxon names by performing a series of text substitutions to remove common inconsistencies in taxonomic nomenclature.}
\usage{
standardise_names(taxon_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxon_names}{A character vector of taxon names that need to be standardised.}
}
\value{
A character vector of standardised taxon names.
}
\description{
The function takes a character vector of taxon names as input and
returns a character vector of taxon names using standardised taxonomic syntax as output.
In particular it standardises taxon rank abbreviations and qualifiers (subsp., var., f.), as people use many variants of these terms.
It also standardises or removes a few additional filler words used within taxon names (affinis becomes aff.; s.l. and s.s. are removed).
