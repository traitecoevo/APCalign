Description: The process of standardising taxon names is necessary when working with biodiversity data. 'APCalign' uses the Australian Plant Name Index (APNI) and the Australian Plant Census (APC) to align and update plant taxon names to current, accepted standards. 'APCalign' can also supply information about the established status of plant taxa across different states/territories.
