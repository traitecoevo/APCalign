When working with biodiversity data, it is important to verify  taxonomic names with an authoritative list and correct any out-of-date names. The 'APCalign' package simplifies this process by:

-   Accessing up-to-date taxonomic information from the [Australian Plant Census](https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/search/taxonomy) and the [Australia Plant Name Index](https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/search/names).
-   Aligning authoritative names to your taxonomic names using our [fuzzy matching algorithm](https://traitecoevo.github.io/APCalign/articles/updating-taxon-names.html)
-   Updating your taxonomic names in a transparent, reproducible manner

## Installation

'APCalign' is currently not on CRAN. You can install its current developmental version using

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("traitecoevo/APCalign")

library(APCalign)
```

To demonstrate how to use 'APCalign', we will use an example dataset `gbif_lite` which is documented in `?gbif_lite`

```{r example data}
dim(gbif_lite)

gbif_lite |> print(n = 6)
```

## Retrieve taxonomic resources

The first step is to retrieve the entire APC and APNI name databases and store them locally as taxonomic resources. We achieve this using `load_taxonomic_resources()`.

There are two versions of the databases that you can retrieve with the `stable_or_current_data` argument. Calling:

-   `stable` will retrieve the most recent, archived version of the databases from our [GitHub releases](https://github.com/traitecoevo/APCalign/releases). This is set as the default option.
-   `current` will retrieve the up-to-date databases directly from the APC and APNI website.

Note that the databases are quite large so the initial retrieval of `stable` versions will take a few minutes. Once the taxonomic resources have been stored locally, subsequent retrievals will take less time. Retrieving `current` resources will always take longer since it is. Check out our [Resource Caching](https://traitecoevo.github.io/APCalign/articles/caching.html) article to learn more about how the APC and APNIC databases are accessed, stored and retrieved.

```{r load resources}
# Benchmarking the retrieval of `stable` or `current` resources
stable_start_time <- Sys.time()
stable_resources <- load_taxonomic_resources(stable_or_current_data = "stable")
stable_end_time <-  Sys.time()

current_start_time <- Sys.time()
current_resources <- load_taxonomic_resources(stable_or_current_data = "current")
current_end_time <-  Sys.time()

# Compare times
stable_end_time - stable_start_time
current_end_time - current_start_time
```

For a more reproducible workflow, we recommend specifying the exact `stable` version you want to use.

```{r}
resources <- load_taxonomic_resources(stable_or_current_data = "stable", version = "0.0.2.9000")
```

## Standardise plant taxon names

Now we can query our taxonomic names against the taxonomic resources we just retrieved using `create_taxonomic_update_lookup()`. This is an all-in-one function will:

- Align your taxonomic names to APNI and APC using our [fuzzy matching algorithm](https://traitecoevo.github.io/APCalign/articles/updating-taxon-names.html)
- Update taxonomic names to APC accepted name.
- Returns NA for names where a match cannot be found

If you would like to learn more about each of these step, take a look at the section [Closer look at name standardisation with 'APCalign'](#closer-look)

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

update_gbif_names <- gbif_lite |> 
  pull(species) |> 
  create_taxonomic_update_lookup(resources = resources)

update_gbif_names |> print(n = 6)
```

The `original_name` is the taxon name used in your original data.
The `aligned_name` is the taxon name we used to link with the APC to identify any synonyms. 
The `apc_name` is the currently, accepted taxon name used by the Australian Plant Census.

We recommend joining the output of `create_taxonomic_update_lookup()` back to your original data so all names

```{r}
gbif_lite |> 
left_join(update_gbif_names,  # Left joining updated taxon names back to original data 
          by = join_by(species == original_name)) |> 
  select(species, ends_with("name"), # Rearranging naming columns
         aligned_reason, infraspecificepithet:decimalLatitude) |> 
  print(n = 6)
```


## Plant established status across states/territories

'APCalign' can also provide the state/territory distribution for established status (native/introduced) from the APC.

We can access the established status data by state/territory using `create_species_state_origin_matrix()`

```{r}
# Retrieve status data by state/territory 
status_matrix <- create_species_state_origin_matrix(resources = resources)

status_matrix |> print(n = 6)
```

Here is a breakdown of all possible values for `origin` 

```{r}
library(purrr)
library(janitor)

# Obtain unique values
status_matrix |> 
  select(-species) |> 
  flatten_chr() |> 
  tabyl()
```

<!-- The formal definitions of the various established status can be found at XX.  -->

You can also obtain the breakdown of species by established status for a particular state/territory using `state_diversity_counts()`

```{r}
state_diversity_counts("NSW", resources = resources)
```

Using the established status data and state/territory information, we can check if a plant taxa is a native using `native_anywhere_in_australia()`

```{r}
update_gbif_names |> 
  sample_n(1) |>  # Choosing a random species
  pull(apc_name) |> # Extracting this APC accepted name
  native_anywhere_in_australia(resources = resources) 
```

## Closer look at name standardisation with 'APCalign' {#closer-look}

`create_taxonomic_update_lookup` is a simple, wrapper, function for novice users that want to quickly check and standardise taxon names. For more experienced users, you can take a look at the sub functions `align_taxa()` and `update_taxonomy()` to see how taxon names are processed, aligned and updated.

![](../man/figures/standardise_taxonomy_workflow.png)

### Aligning names to APNI and APC

This function will:

-   Clean up your taxonomic names <!-- (Getting rid of trailing whitespaces, case correction) -->
-   Find best alignment with APNI to your taxonomic name using our [fuzzy matching algorithm](https://traitecoevo.github.io/APCalign/articles/updating-taxon-names.html)

You can control the degree of fuzzy matching using the arguments `max_distance_abs` and `max_distance_rel`

Note that the `aligned_name` may not be current. This does the best possible effort to match phrase names and subspecific taxa which often have alternative formatting.  This function also searches for small spelling or gender mistakes. 

```{r align names}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

aligned_gbif_taxa <- gbif_lite |> 
  drop_na(species) |>  
  pull(species) |> 
  align_taxa(resources = resources)

aligned_gbif_taxa |> print(n = 6)
```

For every `aligned_name`, `align_taxa()` will provide a `aligned_reason` which you can review as a table of counts:

```{r align reason}
library(janitor)

aligned_gbif_taxa |> 
  pull(aligned_reason) |> 
  tabyl() |> 
  tibble() 
```

### Update taxonomic names to alignments

`update_taxonomy()` will update APNI taxa to specified (or current) version of APC. It will use the general synonymy published by the APC to attempt to sync the taxon names to a specific list. The function will also add other relevant taxonomy columns in the output


```{r update names}
updated_gbif_taxa <- aligned_gbif_taxa |> 
  pull(aligned_name) |> 
  update_taxonomy(resources = resources)

updated_gbif_taxa |> print(n = 6)
```
