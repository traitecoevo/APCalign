When working with biodiversity data, it is important to verify  taxonomic names with an authoritative list and correct any out-of-date names. The 'APCalign' package simplifies this process by:

-   Accessing up-to-date taxonomic information from the [Australian Plant Census](https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/search/taxonomy) and the [Australia Plant Name Index](https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/search/names).
-   Aligning authoritative names to your taxonomic names using our [fuzzy matching algorithm](https://traitecoevo.github.io/APCalign/articles/updating-taxon-names.html)
-   Updating your taxonomic names in a transparent, reproducible manner

## Installation

'APCalign' is currently not on CRAN. You can install its current developmental version using


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("traitecoevo/APCalign")

library(APCalign)
```

To demonstrate how to use 'APCalign', we will use an example dataset `gbif_lite` which is documented in `?gbif_lite`


```{r}
dim(gbif_lite)

gbif_lite |> print(n = 6)
```

## Retrieve taxonomic resources

The first step is to retrieve the entire APC and APNI name databases and store them locally as taxonomic resources. We achieve this using `load_taxonomic_resources()`.

There are two versions of the databases that you can retrieve with the `stable_or_current_data` argument. Calling:

-   `stable` will retrieve the most recent, archived version of the databases from our [GitHub releases](https://github.com/traitecoevo/APCalign/releases). This is set as the default option.
-   `current` will retrieve the up-to-date databases directly from the APC and APNI website.

Note that the databases are quite large so the initial retrieval of `stable` versions will take a few minutes. Once the taxonomic resources have been stored locally, subsequent retrievals will take less time. Retrieving `current` resources will always take longer since it is. Check out our [Resource Caching](https://traitecoevo.github.io/APCalign/articles/caching.html) article to learn more about how the APC and APNIC databases are accessed, stored and retrieved.

```{r}
# Benchmarking the retrieval of `stable` or `current` resources
stable_start_time <- Sys.time()
stable_resources <- load_taxonomic_resources(stable_or_current_data = "stable")
stable_end_time <-  Sys.time()

current_start_time <- Sys.time()
current_resources <- load_taxonomic_resources(stable_or_current_data = "current")
current_end_time <-  Sys.time()

# Compare times
stable_end_time - stable_start_time
```

For a more reproducible workflow, we recommend specifying the exact `stable` version you want to use.

```{r}
resources <- load_taxonomic_resources(stable_or_current_data = "stable", version = "0.0.2.9000")
```

## Align and update plant taxon names

Now we can query our taxonomic names against the taxonomic resources we just retrieved using `create_taxonomic_update_lookup()`. This is an all-in-one function will:

- Align your taxonomic names to APC and APNI using our [matching algorithms](https://traitecoevo.github.io/APCalign/articles/updating-taxon-names.html)  
- Update names to an APC-accepted species or infraspecific name whenever possible.  
- Return a suggested name for all names, defaulting to an `accepted_name` when available, and otherwise providing an APNI name or a name where only a genus-level alignment is possible.  

If you would like to learn more about each of these step, take a look at the section [Closer look at name alignment and updating with 'APCalign'](#closer-look)  

```{r}
library(dplyr)

updated_gbif_names <- gbif_lite |> 
  pull(species) |> 
  create_taxonomic_update_lookup(resources = resources)

updated_gbif_names |> 
  print(n = 6)
```

The `original_name` is the taxon name used in your original data.
The `aligned_name` is the taxon name we used to link with the APC to identify any synonyms. 
The `accepted_name` is the currently, accepted taxon name used by the Australian Plant Census.
The `suggested_name` is the best possible name option for the `original_name`.


## Plant established status across states/territories

'APCalign' can also provide the state/territory distribution for established status (native/introduced) from the APC.

We can access the established status data by state/territory using `create_species_state_origin_matrix()`


```{r}
# Retrieve status data by state/territory 
status_matrix <- create_species_state_origin_matrix(resources = resources)
```

Here is a breakdown of all possible values for `origin` 

```{r}
library(purrr)
library(janitor)

# Obtain unique values
status_matrix |> 
  select(-species) |> 
  flatten_chr() |> 
  tabyl()
```

<!-- The formal definitions of the various established status can be found at XX.  -->

You can also obtain the breakdown of species by established status for a particular state/territory using `state_diversity_counts()`


```{r}
state_diversity_counts("NSW", resources = resources)
```

Using the established status data and state/territory information, we can check if a plant taxa is a native using `native_anywhere_in_australia()`


```{r}
library(dplyr)

updated_gbif_names |> 
  sample_n(1) |>  # Choosing a random species
  pull(suggested_name) |> # Extracting this APC accepted name
  native_anywhere_in_australia(resources = resources) 
```

## Closer look at name standardisation with 'APCalign' {#closer-look}

`create_taxonomic_update_lookup` is a simple, wrapper, function for novice users that want to quickly check and standardise taxon names. For more experienced users, you can take a look at the sub functions `match_taxa()`, `align_taxa()` and `update_taxonomy()` to see how taxon names are processed, aligned and updated.

![](../man/figures/standardise_taxonomy_workflow.png)

### Aligning names to APC and APNI

The function `align_taxa` will:

1.  Clean up your taxonomic names
    - The functions `standardise_names`, `strip_names` and `strip_names_2` standardise infraspecific taxon designations and clean up punctuation and whitespaces  

2.  Find best alignment with APC or APNI to your taxonomic name using our the function [match_taxa](https://traitecoevo.github.io/APCalign/articles/updating-taxon-names.html)  
    - A taxonomic name flows through a progression of [50 match algorithms](https://traitecoevo.github.io/APCalign/articles/tableXXXX) until it is able to be aligned to a name on either the APC or APNI list.  
    - These include [exact and fuzzy matches](#fuzzy-match). Fuzzy matches are designed to capture small spelling mistakes and syntax errors in phrase names.  
    - These include matches to the entire name string and matches on just select words in the sequence.  
    - The sequence of matches has been carefully curated to align names with the fewest mistakes.  
    
3.  Determine the `taxon_rank` to which the name can be resolved, based on its syntax.  
    - For names that can only be resolved to genus, reformats the name to offer a standardised `genus sp.` name, with additional information/notes provided as part of the original name in square brackets, as in `Acacia sp. [skinny leaves]` or `Acacia sp. [Broken Hill]`  

4.  Determine the `taxonomic_reference` (APC or APNI) of each name-alignment.  

**Note** that `align_taxa` **does not** seek to update outdated taxonomy. That process occurs during [update_taxonomy](#update) process. `align_taxa` instead aligns each name input to the closest match amongst names documented by the APC and APNI.  

```{r}
library(dplyr)

aligned_gbif_taxa <- gbif_lite |> 
  pull(species) |> 
  align_taxa(resources = resources)

aligned_gbif_taxa |> 
  print(n = 6)
```

For every `aligned_name`, `align_taxa()` will provide a `aligned_reason` which you can review as a table of counts:

```{r}
library(janitor)

aligned_gbif_taxa |> 
  pull(aligned_reason) |> 
  tabyl() |> 
  tibble() 
```

#### Configuring matching precision and aligned output {#fuzzy-match}

There are arguments in `align_taxa` that allows you to select which of the 50 matching algorithms are activated/deactivated and the degree of fuzziness of the fuzzy matching function  

- `fuzzy_matches` turns fuzzy matching on / off (it defaults to `TRUE`).  
- `fuzzy_abs_dist` and `fuzzy_rel_dist` control the degree of fuzzy matching (they default to `fuzzy_abs_dist = 3` & `fuzzy_rel_dist = 0.2`).  
- `imprecise_fuzzy_matches` turns  imprecise fuzzy matching on / off (it defaults to `FALSE`; for true it is set to `fuzzy_abs_dist = 5` & `fuzzy_rel_dist = 0.5`).  
- `APNI_matches` turns matches to the APNI list on/off (it defaults to `TRUE`).  
- `identifier` allows you to specify a text string that is added to genus-level matches, indicating the site, study, etc e.g. `Acacia sp. [long leaves]`

### Updating to APC-accepted names {#update}

`update_taxonomy()` uses the information generated by `align_taxa()` to, whenever possible, update names to APC-accepted names.  

```{r}
updated_gbif_taxa <- aligned_gbif_taxa |> 
  update_taxonomy(resources = resources)

updated_gbif_taxa |> 
  print(n = 6)
```
#### Taxonomic resources used for updating names

- The APC includes all previously recorded taxonomic names for a current taxon concept, designating the currently-accepted name as `taxonomic_status: accepted`, while previously used or inappropriately used names for the taxon concept have alternative taxonomic statuses documented (e.g. taxonomic synonym, orthographic variant, misapplied).   

- The APC includes a column `acceptedNameUsageID` that links a taxon name with an alternative taxonomic status to the current taxon name, allowing outdated/inappropriately used names to be synced to their current name.  

*Note*: Names listed on the APNI but absent from the APC are those that are designated as `taxonomic_dataset: APNI` by `APCalign`. These are names that are currently `unknown` by the APC. Over time, this list shrinks, as taxonomists link ever more occasionally used name variants to an APC-accepted taxon. However, for now, *names listed only on the APNI cannot be updated*

#### Name updates at different taxonomic levels

- `update_taxonomy()` divides names into lists based on the `taxon_rank` and `taxonomic_dataset` assigned by `align_taxa`, as each list requires different updating algorithms.  
- Only taxonomic names that are designated as `taxon_rank = species/infraspecific` and `taxonomic_dataset = APC` can be updated to an APC-accepted name.  
- For all other taxa, it may be possible to align the genus-name to an APC-accepted genus.  
- For all taxa, a `suggested_name` is provided, selecting the `accepted_name` when available, and otherwise the `aligned_name`, but with, if possible, an updated, APC-accepted genus name.   


#### Taxonomic splits

- Taxonomic splits refers to instances where a single taxon concept is subsequently split into multiple taxon concepts. For such taxa, when the `aligned_name` is the "old" taxon concept name, it is impossible to know which of the currently accepted taxon concepts the name represents.  

- The function `update_taxonomy` includes an argument `taxonomic_splits`, offering three alternative outputs for taxon concepts that have been split.  

  1. `most_likely_species` is the default value, and returns the `accepted_name` of the original taxon_concept; alternative names are documented in square brackets as part of the suggested name (`Acacia aneura [alternative possible names: Acacia minyura (pro parte misapplied) | Acacia paraneura (pro parte misapplied) | Acacia quadrimarginea (misapplied)`).  
  
  2. `return_all` returns all currently accepted names that were split from the original taxon_concept; this leads to an increase in the number of rows in the output table. (Acacia aneura, Acacia minyura and Acacia paraneura are each output as a separate row, each with a unique taxon_ID)  
  
  3. `collapse_to_higher_taxon` declares that for split names, there is no way to be certain about which accepted name is appropriate and therefore that the best possible match is at the genus level; no `accepted_name` is returned, the `taxon_rank` is demoted to `genus` and the suggested name documents the possible species-level names in square brackets (`Acacia sp. [collapsed names: Acacia aneura (accepted) | Acacia minyura (pro parte misapplied) | Acacia paraneura (pro parte misapplied)]`)  

```{r}
library(dplyr)

aligned_gbif_taxa |> 
  update_taxonomy(taxonomic_splits = "most_likely_species", 
                  resources = resources)  |> 
  filter(original_name == "Acacia aneura")  # Subsetting Acacia aneura as an example 
```

```{r}
aligned_gbif_taxa |> 
  update_taxonomy(taxonomic_splits = "return_all",
                  resources = resources)  |> 
  filter(original_name == "Acacia aneura") # Subsetting Acacia aneura as an example
```

```{r}
aligned_gbif_taxa |> 
  update_taxonomy(taxonomic_splits = "collapse_to_higher_taxon",
                  resources = resources)  |> 
  filter(original_name == "Acacia aneura") # Subsetting Acacia aneura as an example
```
