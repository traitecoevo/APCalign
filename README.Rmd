# APCalign <img src="man/figures/APCalign_hex_2.svg" align="right" width="120"/>

'APCalign' uses the [Australian Plant Census (APC)](https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/search/taxonomy) and [Australian Plant Name Index](https://biodiversity.org.au/nsl/services/search/names) to align and update Australian plant taxon name strings. 'APCalign' also supplies information about
the established status (native/introduced) of plant taxa across different states/territories.

## Installation

'APCalign' is current not on CRAN. Install the currently development version: 

```{r install, eval= FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("traitecoevo/APCalign", dependencies = TRUE, upgrade = "ask")

library(APCalign)
```

## A quick demo

Generating a look-up table can be done with just one function

```{r,message=FALSE}
# Load APC/APNI resources into R
resources <- load_taxonomic_resources()

# Create lookup 
create_taxonomic_update_lookup( 
  taxa = c(
    "Banksia integrifolia",
    "Acacia longifolia",
    "Commersonia rosea"
    ),
  resources = resources
)
```

## Shiny application

We also developed a shiny application for non-R users to update and align their taxonomic names. You can find the application here: https://unsw.shinyapps.io/APCalign-app

## Learn more
