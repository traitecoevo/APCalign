#' Match taxonomic names to accepted names in list
#' 
#' This function attempts to match input strings to a list of allowable taxonomic names.
#' It cycles through more than 20 different string patterns, sequentially searching for additional match patterns.
#' It identifies string patterns in input names that suggest a name can only be aligned to a genus (hybrids that are not accepted names; graded species; taxa not identified to species).
#' It prioritises matches that do not require fuzzy matching (i.e. synonyms, orthographic variants) over those that do.
#' If prioritises matches to taxa in the APC over names in the APNI.
#' 
#' @param taxa The list of taxa requiring checking
#
#' @param resources The list(s) of accepted names to check against, loaded through the function `load_taxonomic_resources()`
#' @param fuzzy_abs_dist The number of characters allowed to be different for a fuzzy match.
#' @param fuzzy_rel_dist The proportion of characters allowed to be different for a fuzzy match. 
#' @param fuzzy_matches Fuzzy matches are turned on as a default. The relative and absolute distances allowed for fuzzy matches to species and infraspecific taxon names are defined by the parameters `fuzzy_abs_dist` and `fuzzy_rel_dist`
#' @param imprecise_fuzzy_matches Imprecise fuzzy matches are turned off as a default.
#' @param APNI_matches Name matches to the APNI (Australian Plant Names Index) are turned off as a default.
#' @param identifier A dataset, location or other identifier, which defaults to NA.
