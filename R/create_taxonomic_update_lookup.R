#' Create a lookup table with the best-possible scientific name match for a list of Australian plant names
#'
#' This function takes a list of Australian plant names that need to be reconciled with current taxonomy and 
#' generates a lookup table of the best-possible scientific name match for each input name. 
#' It uses first the function `align_taxa`, then the function `update_taxonomy` to achieve the output.
#'
#' @family taxonomic alignment functions
#'
#' @param taxa A list of Australian plant species that needs to be reconciled with current taxonomy.
#' @param stable_or_current_data either "stable" for a consistent version, or "current" for the leading edge version.
#' @param version The version number of the dataset to use.
#' @param taxonomic_splits How to handle one_to_many taxonomic matches.  Default is "return_all".  The other options are "collapse_to_higher_taxon" and "most_likely_species". most_likely_species defaults to the original_name if that name is accepted by the APC; this will be right for certain species subsets, but make errors in other cases, use with caution.
#' @param full logical for whether the full lookup table is returned or just key columns#' 
#' @param fuzzy_abs_dist The number of characters allowed to be different for a fuzzy match.
#' @param fuzzy_rel_dist The proportion of characters allowed to be different for a fuzzy match. 
#' @param fuzzy_matches Fuzzy matches are turned on as a default. The relative and absolute distances allowed for fuzzy matches to species and infraspecific taxon names are defined by the parameters `fuzzy_abs_dist` and `fuzzy_rel_dist`
#' @param resources These are the taxonomic resources used for cleaning, this will default to loading them from a local place on your computer.  If this is to be called repeatedly, it's much faster to load the resources using \code{\link{load_taxonomic_resources}} separately and pass the data in.
#' @param APNI_matches Name matches to the APNI (Australian Plant Names Index) are turned off as a default. 
#' @param imprecise_fuzzy_matches Imprecise fuzzy matches are turned on as a default.
#' @param identifier A dataset, location or other identifier, which defaults to NA.
#' @param quiet Logical to indicate whether to display messages while aligning taxa.
#' @param output file path to save the output. If this file already exists, this function will check if it's a subset of the species passed in and try to add to this file. This can be useful for large and growing projects. 
#' @return A lookup table containing the accepted and suggested names for each original name input, and additional taxonomic information such as taxon rank, taxonomic status, taxon IDs and genera. 
#' - original_name: the original plant name.
#' - aligned_name: the input plant name that has been aligned to a taxon name in the APC or APNI by the align_taxa function.
#' - accepted_name: the APC-accepted plant name, when available.
#' - suggested_name: the suggested plant name to use. Identical to the accepted_name, when an accepted_name exists; otherwise the the suggested_name is the aligned_name.
#' - genus: the genus of the accepted (or suggested) name; only APC-accepted genus names are filled in.
#' - family: the family of the accepted (or suggested) name; only APC-accepted family names are filled in.
#' - taxon_rank: the taxonomic rank of the suggested (and accepted) name.
#' - taxonomic_dataset: the source of the suggested (and accepted) names (APC or APNI).
#' - taxonomic_status: the taxonomic status of the suggested (and accepted) name.
#' - taxonomic_status_aligned: the taxonomic status of the aligned name, before any taxonomic updates have been applied.
#' - aligned_reason: the explanation of a specific taxon name alignment (from an original name to an aligned name).
#' - update_reason: the explanation of a specific taxon name update (from an aligned name to an accepted or suggested name).
#' - subclass: the subclass of the accepted name.
#' - taxon_distribution: the distribution of the accepted name; only filled in if an APC accepted_name is available.
#' - scientific_name_authorship: the authorship information for the accepted (or synonymous) name; available for both APC and APNI names.
#' - taxon_ID: the unique taxon concept identifier for the accepted_name; only filled in if an APC accepted_name is available.
#' - taxon_ID_genus: an identifier for the genus; only filled in if an APC-accepted genus name is available.
#' - scientific_name_ID: an identifier for the nomenclatural (not taxonomic) details of a scientific name; available for both APC and APNI names.
#' - row_number: the row number of a specific original_name in the input.
#' - number_of_collapsed_taxa: when taxonomic_splits == "collapse_to_higher_taxon", the number of possible taxon names that have been collapsed.
